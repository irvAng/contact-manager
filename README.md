# contact-manager
A JavaScript contact manager.

The Contact Manager project is a work I did for W3C's introductory course to JavaScript (see below for orginal version). My version of the project adds the following functionalities:

-Improvement of the CSS

-Added delete feature, trash bin icon, and hover on trash bin cell.

-Use of dataset.id for the trash bin listener.

-Search form, which also reduces the table as it is typed into it.

-Sortable header using different sort algorithms.

A live version of the contact manager can as well be found here: [Contact manager - CodePen](https://codepen.io/ialuna/pen/eyZYRJ?editors=0010).
