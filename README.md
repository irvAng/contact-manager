# contact-manager
A JavaScript contact manager for edX JS Intro Course.

The Contact Manager project is a work I did for W3C's introductory course to JavaScript (see below for orginal version). My version of the project adds the following functionalities:

-Improvement of the CSS
-Added delete feature, trash bin icon, and hover on trash bin cell.
-Use of dataset.id for the trash bin listener.
-Search form, which also reduces the table as it is typed into it.
-Sortable header using different sort algorithms.

A live version of the contact manager can as well be seen here: http://irvingangulo.com/assets/cm-f/contact-manager/.
